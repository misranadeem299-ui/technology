        <h1> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in Daily Life</h1><p>
            <h2> Introduction </h2>In todayâ€™s modern world, technology plays a central role in almost every aspect of human life, and two of the most powerful innovations are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, or recognizing speech and images. Machine Learning, a branch of AI, allows machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being directly programmed. These technologies are no longer limited to research labs or science fiction movies; they are actively shaping daily routines, from the way people communicate to the way they work, travel, and manage their health.
